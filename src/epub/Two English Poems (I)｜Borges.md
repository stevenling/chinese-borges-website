The useless dawn finds me in a deserted Street  
corner; I have outlived the night. 

在空寂的街角找到我，黎明哦，我比黑夜更长久。



Nights are proud waves: darkblue topheavy   
waves laden with all hues of deep spoil, laden   
with things unlikely and desirable. 

夜——盛情的海浪，靛蓝、倒悬的波穗述说着深土层层颜色、载动浮幻与渴望。



Nights have a habit of mysterious gifts and re  
fusals, of things half given away, half with  
held, of joys with a dark hemisphere. Nights   
act that way, I tell you. 

夜偷偷地恩赐和拒绝，一次次给予你所保留的事物，一个黑暗半球的欣欣向荣。

我把夜的习惯告诉你——



The surge, that night, left me the customary shreds   
and odd ends: some hated friends to chat with,   
music for dreams, and the smoking of bitter   
ashes. The things my hungry heart has no use for.   
The big wave brought you. 

它的碎波留下无关紧要的琐屑：一两个泛泛之交、梦中音乐与灰烬的烟雾。

我饥渴的心百无一用。汹涌的濩渃带来了你。



Words, any words, your laughter; and you so   
lazily and incessantly beautiful. We talked   
and you have forgotten the words.   
The shattering dawn finds me in a deserted   
street of my city. 

言语、言语、你的笑声，慵懒的美丽如痴如醉。

我们促膝而谈、直到你开始忘记词语。

绝望的黎明走进了城市——我那孤寂的街道。



Your profile turned away, the sounds that go to   
make your name, the lilt of your laughter:   
these are the illustrious toys you have left me.   
I turn them over in the dawn, I lose them, I   
find them; I tell them to the few stray dogs   
and to the few stray stars of the dawn. 

你的侧影转过身，组成你名字的旋律、爽朗的笑声，残留的美丽我仍意犹未尽。

我将你的一切交给黎明，我失去它们；向走失的荒狗讲述、向晨曦时零散的星星倾吐。



Your dark rich life . . .   
I must get at you, somehow: I put away those   
illustrious toys you have left me, I want your   
hidden look, your real smile—that lonely,   
mocking smile your cool mirror knows.

你隐蔽而丰富的一生 ...

我设法得到：撇开你迷人表象，我要隐藏的容貌，真实的欢颜，那冰冷、嘲弄的笑容——只有镜子知道。
